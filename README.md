# Assembly Playground

If you code without knowing what's going on into the machine, please
stop doing it.

* **Assembly language:** Play with some simple example and see how it
    is compiled into assembly (GAS).

* **Machine language:** Machine language is not assembly one but it is
    its representation into bytes. While assembly is readable by
    human, machine code is readable by the machine (no shit!)
